**Hand Gesture Control for Hill Climb Game**


Control the Hill Climb game with your hand gestures using this Python code! The application leverages the Mediapipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for camera access. Make sure you have the Hill Climb game installed from the Microsoft Store before running the code.


Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Use the following commands to install the required packages:


pip install mediapipe
pip install opencv-python
pip install pynput


Run the Code:
Execute the provided Python script hand_gesture_control.py to activate the hand gesture control for the Hill Climb game.

Camera Access:
Ensure that your camera is accessible, and the Hill Climb game is running in the background.

Hand Gestures:
Closing Hand:
Closing your hand will act as a brake, slowing down the vehicle in the Hill Climb game.

Opening Hand:
Opening your hand will act as an accelerator, making the vehicle accelerate in the game.

Notes:
Adjust the camera position to ensure accurate hand tracking.
The code uses the pynput library for simulating keypress events to control the Hill Climb game.
Feel free to customize and extend the code to suit your preferences!
